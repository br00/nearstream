# Architecture

How the code is laid out. Pairs with [`NEARSTREAM.md`](./NEARSTREAM.md), which holds philosophy + decisions. This file holds shape.

> **Status:** Phase 2 · Slice 14 (Notebook home + Letter primitive — first site template) — `alessandroborelli.it` stops looking like a generic personal-publishing demo and becomes *Alessandro's site*. The home is now a one-column quiet page in the shape of a personal homepage from before social media: animated Human Circle masthead, a **Letter** block (dated, signed, prose body — editable from `/studio`), then Stream + Pictures + Essays + Elsewhere as four short text-shaped sections. The Letter is a new single-record primitive (`site/letter.json` in R2) — the highest-leverage editorial slot on the site, so it lives at the top of the studio too. The Stream timeline moves to `/stream` (the home no longer is the feed).

Public surface:
- `GET /` — anyone, anonymous.
- `GET /api/stream` — anyone, anonymous. (Reader / RSS will use this in later slices.)

Gated surface:
- `GET /studio` — requires session (proxy redirect + real check in page).
- `POST /api/stream` — requires session (401 otherwise).

Sessions are signed cookies. There is no session store. Rotating `AUTH_SECRET` invalidates every session and every outstanding magic link in one step.

```

The upload path bypasses Vercel's 4.5 MB function body limit because the bytes go *directly browser ⇄ R2*. The read path uses a server-proxy so the bucket can stay private (no public R2 domain needed).

## Rules followed

1. **Schemas are the single source of truth.** `schemas/stream.ts` exports the `StreamEntry` type *and* `DISCIPLINE_TAGS` *and* `isDisciplineTag()`. One file feeds the form, the route handler, and the public render. ("schema-as-code" — NEARSTREAM.md §05.)

2. **Store is an interface, not a database.** `lib/store.ts` picks `InMemoryStore` or `R2Store` at module load from `R2_*` env vars. The rest of the app doesn't know.

3. **Auth is one file, no SDK.** `lib/auth.ts` contains the entire auth surface: HMAC sign/verify, magic-link token, session cookie, allowlist. Web Crypto only — no `jose`, no `next-auth`. The Resend client in `lib/email.ts` is `fetch` against `api.resend.com`.

4. **Optimistic check + real check.** `proxy.ts` does a cheap cookie-presence check on every `/studio/*` request (no HMAC, no DB — runs on prefetches). `getSession()` in the page / route does the real HMAC verify. Standard Next 16 pattern.

5. **Public render is a server component.** `app/page.tsx` reads the store directly at request time. No client-side fetching, no API call from the browser. `/api/stream` exists for posting and for future readers / RSS.

## Design system (Nearstream chrome layer) + site templates

`app/_components/` is the **Nearstream chrome** layer — the platform identity that every Nearstream instance carries. NEARSTREAM.md §02 distinguishes the *reader* (Nearstream's territory) from the *site* (the user's territory). These components belong to the Nearstream side.

**Site-template components** live in `app/_components/site/` — currently Alessandro's only (the `HumanCircle` port of his moving.points sketch). When Phase 3 introduces multi-tenancy, per-user templates can move into per-user directories or a registry. Site components inherit the global palette tokens so they compose with chrome without color clashes.

```
app/_components/
├── nearstream-mark.tsx    constellation logo (NearstreamMark) + lockup (NearstreamLockup)
├── page-shell.tsx         top nav (lockup + optional right-nav) + footer ({year}_)
├── kicker.tsx             small-caps mono label ("Stream", "Studio", form labels)
├── button.tsx             outlined ghost button + buttonClasses helper
├── submit-button.tsx      client-component variant that auto-disables on form submit
├── input.tsx              bottom-border text input
├── textarea.tsx           bordered textarea
└── tag-chip.tsx           TagChip (display) + TagRadio (selectable)
```

The `/design` route is the live spec — color swatches, type scale, brand mark sizes, every component in every state. It is the single source of truth: pages compose components, `/design` shows components, components own their styles.

**Tokens** (in `app/globals.css`):
- `--background: #000` · `--foreground: #e4e4e7` · `--muted: #a1a1aa` · `--muted-soft: #71717a` · `--border: #27272a`
- No accent color, no light mode. The palette is the deployed landing site at `nearstream-khaki.vercel.app` ported verbatim, with `muted` lightened one step (from `#71717a` to `#a1a1aa`) so app text reads at functional contrast — the landing-site whisper stays available as `muted-soft`.

## Why these choices

- **The home page is a *site template*, not a feed.** `/` reads as a personal homepage from before social media: animated Human Circle + name, then a dated/signed Letter, then four quiet sections (Stream / Pictures / Essays / Elsewhere) with at most 4–6 items each. Each section label is a `<Link>` to the full archive (`/stream`, `/library/inventory`, `/library`). The home cannot doom-scroll — it ends. The full Stream timeline moved to `/stream`. This layout shape is the result of converging on "what would I want my site to feel like" through ~12 prototypes against three tests: not Twitter (Mixed-feed failed Gosia's "can't stay more than 1 min"), not Squarespace (snap-paginated codex failed because polish + control reads as marketing), and not naveen.com purity (text-only loses the photographer-as-host first impression). The result: text-shaped lists with photos *available* (via small thumbnail rows) but not *displayed* on the home.
- **The Letter is the highest-leverage editorial slot.** A dated, signed prose block at the top of the home. Editable from `/studio` (first form, before Stream/Essay/Inventory) because it changes most often — when Alessandro's focus changes, he edits the Letter. Single-record store (`site/letter.json`) — there is only ever one current letter. The `updatedAt` is set by the store; the displayed date is a free-form string the host can write expressively ("today", "midsummer", or a real date). The home renders nothing for an unset Letter — graceful empty state.
- **Site templates live in `app/_components/site/`.** Distinct from `app/_components/` (Nearstream chrome). `HumanCircle` is the only one so far — Alessandro's port of his moving.points sketch. Phase 3 multi-tenancy may move per-user templates into per-user directories. For now, single-user, single template, lives next to chrome but logically separate.
- **No Sanity.** Studio is built into the app (NEARSTREAM.md §05: *"friends will not learn a second tool with a second login."*).
- **No Vercel-specific APIs.** Standard Next features only — `revalidatePath`, route handlers, server components, Proxy. Same code will run on Fly.io / Hetzner.
- **Delete is signed-in-only, inline on the public list/detail pages, via tiny POST forms.** No "manage" dashboard, no API DELETE method (HTML forms can't issue it). `DeleteButton` is a 20-line client component that wraps a `<form action method="POST">` and adds `confirm()` so an accidental click doesn't nuke an entry. Server routes (`/api/stream/[id]/delete`, `/api/essays/[slug]/delete`, `/api/inventory/[slug]/delete`) all check `getSession()`, run the store's delete method, call `revalidatePath` on the affected routes, then redirect back to the parent list. Inventory delete cascades: the store fetches the metadata first, deletes the original image + thumbnail via `mediaStore.deleteImage()`, then deletes the metadata JSON. Cascade failures are logged but don't block metadata delete — better an orphaned image in R2 than an undeletable item in the UI.
- **R2 via `aws4fetch`, wrapped in `R2Client`.** `lib/r2-client.ts` wraps `AwsClient` with **retry-once on transient TLS errors** (`ERR_SSL_SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE` + a few related signals). Vercel functions go cold between requests; Node's HTTPS occasionally hits a handshake hiccup on the first call to R2 from a warming function. Without the wrapper, that cold-start hiccup surfaces as a 500 to the user. With it, the second attempt almost always succeeds and the user sees nothing. All four R2-using stores (Stream, Essay, Inventory, Media) construct `R2Client` instead of bare `AwsClient`, so the retry is centralized. AWS SDK is ~1.6 MB of features we don't need.
- **Auth via raw HMAC, not `jose` / `next-auth` / Lucia.** Same ethos. ~30 lines of Web Crypto. Standard auth libraries assume a multi-provider, refresh-token, RBAC world Nearstream will never have.
- **Allowlist in env var.** Adding a friend = redeploy. Friction by design.
- **Magic-link login leaks nothing.** The login page always shows "if that email is on the allowlist, a link is on its way" — same response either way. No allowlist enumeration.
- **Resend via `fetch`, not the SDK.** Dev mode (no `RESEND_API_KEY` / `RESEND_FROM`) prints the link to console — same fallback shape as the R2 picker in slice 2.
- **Form posts, not client JS.** Login + studio both work with JS off.
- **`force-dynamic` on `/` and `/rss.xml`.** Prevents Next from caching the timeline or feed at build. Caching is still an open question (see below).
- **RSS via raw template string, no library.** Same ethos as auth and R2: a few well-escaped lines of XML beat a dependency. `escapeXml` covers attribute + text contexts; `<description>` uses `<![CDATA[…]]>` with a `]]>` splitter so content is passed through verbatim. Stream item title is derived from the first line of `text` (≤80 chars); Essay item title is the essay's title verbatim.
- **One combined feed, not separate Stream and Library feeds.** `/rss.xml` returns both primitives merged by `publishedAt`. A friend subscribing to your domain expects "everything Alessandro posts" in their reader — one feed matches that mental model. If a feed reader wants only essays it can filter on `<category>Essay</category>`. Splitting into `/rss.xml` + `/library/rss.xml` would force friends to subscribe twice; revisit only if a real reader demands it.
- **Essay body shipped as rendered HTML in CDATA, not raw markdown.** Feed readers render HTML; almost none render markdown. `marked.parse(body)` runs server-side at request time. Same `escapeCdata` `]]>` splitter as Stream items so the closing token can't appear inside the body.
- **`<guid isPermaLink="true">` for essays + inventory, `isPermaLink="false"` for stream entries.** Essays and inventory items have stable URLs (`/library/{slug}` / `/library/inventory/{slug}`); the guid is that URL. Stream entries have no per-entry permalink (only the `#entry-{id}` anchor on `/`), so we use the bare UUID with `isPermaLink="false"` — the RSS spec for guids without a fetchable resource.
- **Stream → Library bridge via optional `link` field on `StreamEntry`.** The schema gains `link?: { type: 'essay' | 'inventory', slug: string }`. Only the type + slug are stored — the linked entry's title is resolved at render time by looking it up against `essayStore.list()` / `inventoryStore.list()` (both already fetched on the home page and in `/rss.xml`). Render-time lookup means deleting the linked entry just silently removes the arrow — no broken links, no orphaned cached titles. Form submission encodes the link as a single dropdown value `type::slug` (`essay::my-essay-slug`); the API parses either that form-encoded string or a structured JSON object. The studio dropdown lists all current essays + inventory items (with `<optgroup>` for each type) so the user picks from existing content. Empty selection = no link.
- **Inventory items in RSS ship as `<enclosure>` (image binary) + `<description>` (HTML body).** Per RSS spec, `<enclosure>` is the proper way to attach a media file to an item (originally for podcasts, broadly supported). The full image gets the enclosure with its byte length + content type. The `<description>` CDATA contains an `<img>` tag (so readers that ignore enclosures still render the image inline), the markdown description rendered via `marked` (if present), and a small `<dl>` of any filled metadata (dimensions / materials / edition / status / price). We use the full image — not the thumbnail — because feed polls are infrequent and readers display at varying sizes; better to give them the full quality once than serve a fuzzy thumb.
- **Item links are anchors on `/`, not per-entry permalink pages.** Entries render with `id={`entry-${entry.id}`}` on the timeline; the feed's `<link>` is `${SITE_URL}/#entry-${entry.id}`. Real per-entry routes belong to a later slice (Phase 2 library primitives will introduce per-entry URLs).
- **Two stores, not one generic store with a discriminator.** `lib/store.ts` (Stream) and `lib/essay-store.ts` (Essay) are sibling files, each owning their own interface + InMemory + R2 implementations + picker. They share the same R2 bucket but different prefixes (`entries/` vs `library/essays/`). Reasons: (1) primitives have different shapes — Essay has slug + body + getBySlug, Stream has tag + force-permalink-less. A generic `Store<T>` would either lose type-precision or grow ugly. (2) Each primitive's store can evolve independently (Essay may add `getBySlug` cache, Stream may add filtering by tag). (3) Mirrors the manifesto's "typed primitive" model — each primitive is its own thing with its own rendering, schema, and persistence.
- **Markdown via `marked`, not MDX or `remark` + plugins.** Single package, no deps, no React-in-content complexity. `marked.parse(body, { async: true })` returns HTML, injected via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` into a `.prose-essay` block with minimal styles in `globals.css`. Sanitization deferred — the only author is the allowlist user themselves, so XSS through self-authored content is irrelevant. If Phase 3 multi-tenant introduces friend-authored essays read by *you*, revisit (DOMPurify on server or `marked`'s sanitize hook).
- **Slugs derived from title at write time, collision rejected.** `slugify(title)` strips diacritics, lowercases, kebab-cases, caps at 80 chars. If the resulting slug already exists in R2 the POST returns 409 and the user re-titles. No silent suffixing — the title is the URL is the identity. Renaming an entry would change the slug + URL; the workaround is delete + republish (delete shipped in slice 9 follow-up).
- **`force-dynamic` on `/library` + `/library/[slug]`.** Same as `/` and `/rss.xml` — pragmatic for slice 7 volumes. Caching is the same open question.
- **Images upload direct from the browser to R2 via presigned URLs, NOT via Vercel function body.** Vercel functions cap incoming request bodies at 4.5 MB — too small for full-quality phone photos. Instead, the studio runs a three-step flow: (1) browser POSTs to `/api/inventory/upload-url` asking for a temporary signed URL; (2) Vercel function uses aws4fetch's `signQuery: true` mode to generate a 5-minute presigned PUT URL bound to a specific `content-type` and key, returns it; (3) browser PUTs the file *directly to R2* via the signed URL — Vercel never sees the bytes. After the PUT succeeds, the browser POSTs metadata to `/api/inventory` with the image key. Result: **no upload size limit short of R2's 5 GB per-object cap**, no paid services, identical code on Fly / Hetzner (where there's no body-cap quirk at all). Same pattern Dropbox / Notion / Figma use for the same reason.
- **Read images via server-proxy at `/api/media/{key}`, NOT a public R2 bucket.** Keeps the R2 bucket private (one set of credentials, one configuration). Browser fetches `/api/media/abc.jpg`; the Vercel function GETs from R2 and streams the body back with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` so browsers cache aggressively (R2 keys never change — UUIDs). Bandwidth flows through Vercel (100 GB/mo Hobby tier). For a personal site visited by ~10 close friends, that's ~33,000 image views/month before approaching the cap — not a constraint at Nearstream scale. Migration to a public R2 custom domain is a ~30-min change later if it ever matters.
- **Thumbnails are generated in the browser at upload time, not on the server.** The studio uses `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas` (with a regular-canvas fallback for older Safari) to make a 600 px max-dimension JPEG (~80 KB for a 14 MB original) before the upload step. `/api/inventory/upload-url` returns **two** presigned R2 PUT URLs (original + thumbnail), the browser uploads both in parallel, and `InventoryImage.thumbKey` carries the thumbnail's R2 key alongside `image.key`. Archive grid (`/library/inventory`, `/library` hub) uses `thumbKey`; detail page (`/library/inventory/[slug]`) uses the full `key`. Result: an archive of 30 inventory items loads ~2.4 MB total (30 × 80 KB thumbs) instead of ~400 MB (30 × ~14 MB originals). **No server-side image library** (no `sharp`, no Vercel image optimizer, no Cloudflare Images, no paid service, no Vercel lock-in). The cost is one extra browser-side step (~1–2 s on a 14 MB photo). The fallback if `thumbKey` is missing (older items, decode failures) is to use the full `key` — graceful degradation. `image.width` and `image.height` are also captured during thumbnail generation and stored in metadata so detail pages can declare intrinsic dimensions on `<img>` and avoid layout shift.
- **`InventoryUploadForm` is a client component — the one place studio breaks "no client JS".** Three-step upload (get URL → PUT → POST metadata) plus upload progress + cellular-data warning + file picker can't be done without JS. Studio's other forms (Stream, Essay) remain plain server-rendered forms that submit without JS. The trade is acceptable because: (a) public reading paths are still server-rendered (the JS exception is gated behind auth), (b) file uploads have always been a JS-era thing, and (c) the alternative (multipart through Vercel) means the 4 MB cap for everyone.
- **CORS on the R2 bucket is required.** The browser is making cross-origin PUT requests to `*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. Without CORS configured on the bucket, the PUT preflight fails. Config is one-time per bucket via Cloudflare dashboard — see the Deploy section below.
- **Slug uniqueness is per-primitive, not global.** An essay can have slug `garden` (URL `/library/garden`); an inventory item can also have slug `garden` (URL `/library/inventory/garden`). Different URLs, no collision. The one edge case: an essay titled "Inventory" would slug to `inventory` and shadow the inventory archive at `/library/inventory`. Next.js prefers static routes over dynamic ones, so the inventory archive wins; the essay would 404 at its expected URL. We accept this as theoretical (extremely unlikely essay title) until either (a) someone hits it or (b) a future slice moves essays to `/library/essays/[slug]`. Tracked in open questions.
- **Inventory metadata fields are mostly optional.** Title + image required; description / dimensions / materials / edition / status / price all optional. Lets the same primitive serve casual photo posting (just title + image) and structured object inventory (everything filled). The detail page renders only the fields that have values — empty fields don't show as "Dimensions: —".
- **Allowed image types: jpeg, png, webp, gif.** No HEIC (iPhone's default — browsers can't display it; would need server-side conversion via `libheif` or similar). iPhones export JPEG when sharing through most apps, so this is rarely a problem in practice. Listed allowlist gated at both the presign step and the metadata-save step (defense in depth — a malicious client could request a different content type at PUT time, but the metadata save would reject it).

```

**Env vars (set in Vercel project settings, mirrored in `.env.local` for dev):**

| Var | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID | Cloudflare → R2 → Overview |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 token (Object R/W on bucket) | Cloudflare → R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | matching secret | shown once on token creation |
| `R2_BUCKET` | bucket name | the bucket we created in slice 2 |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | HMAC key for sessions + magic links | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS` | comma-separated allowlist | hand-curated |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend token | resend.com → API Keys |
| `RESEND_FROM` | sender address | `onboarding@resend.dev` (interim) or verified-domain address |
| `NEARSTREAM_SITE_URL` | absolute origin for RSS + metadata | the prod URL (e.g. `https://nearstream-xxx.vercel.app` or custom domain) |

**No `vercel.json`.** Default Next.js detection handles the build (`next build`) and output. Anything in `vercel.json` would be a Vercel-shaped configuration step we'd have to undo on Fly later.

**Deploy on push.** Vercel watches `main` by default. Branches (slice/*) get preview deployments — useful for end-to-end smoke testing without merging.

**Custom domain (deferred to a follow-up slice).** When ready: add the domain in Vercel → Domains, repoint DNS (Cloudflare Registrar / Namecheap) to Vercel's A/AAAA records, then update `NEARSTREAM_SITE_URL` env var. Also verify the same domain in Resend so magic-links send from `hello@<domain>` instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`.

**R2 CORS (required since slice 9).** The browser PUTs images directly to R2 via presigned URLs. Without CORS configured, the preflight `OPTIONS` request fails and the upload never happens. Configure once per bucket via Cloudflare → R2 → bucket → **Settings** → **CORS Policy**:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://alessandroborelli.it",
      "https://nearstream-indol.vercel.app",
      "https://*.vercel.app",
      "http://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["content-type"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

`AllowedOrigins` should include: your production domain(s), the Vercel auto-subdomain, the `*.vercel.app` wildcard so preview deploys work too, and `localhost:3000` for dev. Adjust to your domains.

## Open architectural questions (carry forward)

- **List cost / caching.** `store.list()`, `essayStore.list()`, and now `inventoryStore.list()` each do one `ListObjectsV2` + N parallel GETs every page render. The Library hub `/library` calls two of them in parallel; `/rss.xml` calls two; getBySlug calls list internally on each single page. Fine for slice 1–9 volumes, but unbounded. A later slice should add a cached read path — likely an in-process LRU keyed on the bucket's `LastModified` of each prefix, with the relevant `revalidatePath` calls already wired from the POST routes.
- **R2 layout if entries grow.** Currently flat (`entries/{id}.json`). Tracked as a GitHub issue — likely move to `entries/YYYY/MM/{id}.json`.
- **Tag set.** `Code / Photo / Music / Writing` is the slice 1 set. Adding `Reading`, `Travel`, `Cooking` is one-line in `schemas/stream.ts` — defer until needed.
- **`StreamEntry.id`.** Currently `crypto.randomUUID()`. Slice 5 did not need to change this — the store already sorts by `publishedAt` and the feed `<guid>` is stable per entry regardless of ordering. Revisit when (a) pagination requires cursor IDs, or (b) we want lexicographically sortable R2 keys.
- **`force-dynamic`.** Pragmatic for slice 1. A later slice should swap to `revalidatePath` only (already wired in `POST /api/stream` and `POST /api/essays`) and let `/`, `/rss.xml`, `/library`, and `/library/[slug]` cache between posts.
- **Delete shipped in slice 9 follow-up.** Every primitive (Stream / Essay / Inventory) has a signed-in `delete` affordance on every public list and detail page. POSTs to `/api/{primitive}/{id|slug}/delete`, server checks session, store handles cascade (inventory removes its image + thumbnail from R2 too). Edit is still deferred — same rationale as before (slug rotation breaks URLs; rewriting in place leaves URL/content mismatch). Delete + republish is the workaround when you need to revise.
- **Combined feed only.** Slice 8 ships one `/rss.xml` for both Stream and Library. If a reader wants only-essays or only-stream, that's filtering on the `<category>` tag client-side. A real per-primitive feed (`/library/rss.xml`) waits for a real ask.
- **Magic-link single-use.** Slice 3 tokens are time-bound (15 min) but technically replayable inside that window — verifying single-use would require persisted state (an R2 key with the token's nonce, deleted on use). For a 1–5-person allowlist this is acceptable risk; revisit if the allowlist grows or the threat model changes.
- **CSRF on POST routes.** Right now `POST /api/stream` and `POST /auth/logout` are protected by the session cookie alone. Browsers default-block cross-site cookie sends with `SameSite=Lax`, so this is fine for form-posts initiated from same-origin pages. If a slice adds cross-origin posting (the reader posting back? an iOS shortcut?), revisit with a CSRF token or `SameSite=Strict`.
- **Form idempotency.** The `SubmitButton` client component disables itself on submit, which prevents double-clicks *when JS is on*. With JS off, a fast user could still double-submit and create two entries. A real fix is server-side: hidden idempotency token in the form, server stores submitted tokens (e.g. in an `idempotency/{token}` R2 key) and rejects repeats. Deferred — not worth the plumbing for a 1-user app.
- **Essay slug `inventory` collides with the inventory archive route.** `/library/inventory` is a static route (inventory archive). If someone publishes an essay titled "Inventory", its slug becomes `inventory`, and the essay route `/library/[slug]` would resolve to `/library/inventory` — but Next.js prefers static routes, so the inventory archive wins and the essay 404s. Same issue exists for any future static sub-route at `/library/{name}`. A clean fix: move essays to `/library/essays/[slug]` (with a redirect from the old `/library/{slug}` for back-compat against URLs already in the RSS feed). Deferred until either it bites someone or we ship a third primitive that would force the refactor anyway.
- **Thumbnails landed in slice 9 follow-up — done.** Browser-side `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas` at upload time. No server-side `sharp` needed. See the "Why" note above.
- **Direct-to-R2 upload from non-JS clients.** The slice 9 upload path requires JavaScript. If the architecture ever needs to support a `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">` upload — e.g., an iOS Shortcut posting to a URL — we'd need a parallel server-proxy path with the 4 MB Vercel limit, or migrate compute off Vercel. Mark when/if it becomes real.
- **HEIC support.** iPhone's default photo format isn't displayable by browsers. Server-side conversion via `libheif` is heavy. Workaround for now: tell users iPhone Photos converts to JPEG when sharing through most apps. Revisit only if a real friend hits this.
- **Image dimensions landed alongside thumbnails — done.** `image.width` and `image.height` are captured during browser-side thumbnail generation (the `ImageBitmap` exposes them) and stored in the inventory metadata. Detail page sets `width`/`height` on `<img>` for layout-shift-free loads.
